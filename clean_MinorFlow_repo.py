"""Remove the heavy run artefacts from this viewer repository.

Deletes every .list, .vcd, .fst and gem5 debug-trace file, and every
__pycache__ folder, anywhere under the repository this script sits in.

It still keeps KEEP_DIRS whole, which is what protects the CARLA 2026
validation set: that is the evidence behind a published paper, not a run that
can be repeated.

The viewer JSONs in tests/ are left alone. A trace is an input that
can be produced again by rerunning.
