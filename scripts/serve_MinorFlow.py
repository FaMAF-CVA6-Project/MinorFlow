"""Serve MinorFlow over HTTP so it can be used from a container.

A container has no browser and no display. Serving the page and publishing
the port puts it in the host's browser while the trace stays inside. The
page opens the samples tests/samples.js lists, which make_MinorFlow_sample.py
writes, and any other JSON only from the host's disk.

    python3 scripts/serve_MinorFlow.py           # port 8000, the page's folder
    python3 scripts/serve_MinorFlow.py --port 9000
    python3 scripts/serve_MinorFlow.py --root ..
    python3 scripts/serve_MinorFlow.py --bind 0.0.0.0

It listens on 127.0.0.1, so a run on a laptop does not offer the repository
to the network, and on 0.0.0.0 inside a container, which a published port
needs. Inside a container it sits in scripts/ and is run from the root.
Either way the folder served is worked out from where a viewer page is, and
--root overrides it.

Start the container with the port published, or nothing outside it can
connect. The two containers take different host ports, so both viewers can be
served at once:

    docker run -it --name gem5 -p 8000:8000 manuel313/famaf_gem5 bash

make_containers.py publishes that, and docker_run.py reads the mapping back, so
the URL it prints is the host one.
