The same tool the CVA6 fork runs over itself, with the checks a viewer
repository can answer. Its helpers, its check protocol and its main are shared
blocks, identical in scripts/check_CVA6_repo.py in that fork and in the other
viewer's checker, and the shared-blocks check keeps them that way. A check
returns a list of messages, empty when it passes, and a message starting with
"SKIP " means it could not run.
