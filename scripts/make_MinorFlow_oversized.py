"""Build a JSON past both of the viewer's limits, to exercise its large-JSON
paths.

MinorFlow.html has two limits, and a test JSON should cross both:

    MAX_JSON_BYTES          past which it counts the records first
    MAX_STREAM_INSTRUCTIONS past which it offers a range

Both are read from the page's limits block when this runs, so the closing
message always names the page's own values.

A seed JSON is read once and repeated. Repetition k moves every cycle by k
times the seed's cycle span, every id and id reference by k times the seed's
largest id and every fetch line by k times one more than its largest line,
and repeats the event arrays with the records, so each repetition reads like
the seed and the viewer meets the size, never an unusual shape.
metadata.stats keeps the seed's counters, apart from n_records.
