"""Build a trace too large for the viewer to load, to exercise its refusal.

MinorFlow.html gives up in two ways, and a test file should cross both:

    MAX_JSON_BYTES          500 MiB, above which the file is refused outright
    MAX_STREAM_INSTRUCTIONS 500,000 records, the cap on the object graph

The output is a real tracer JSON, not a fabricated one. A seed trace is read
once and its records are repeated with every cycle field shifted forward, so
what the viewer refuses is the size, never the shape.
